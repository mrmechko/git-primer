        <p>When you&rsquo;re working on a file or a document, it is
        important to save frequently in order to make sure you
        don&rsquo;t lose your work. But code is complicated. The
        development of code is not linear - often edits are
        exploratory and end up being reverted. You find quickly
        that what you want to be able to save and explore is not
        the actual state of your files, but the sequence of edits
        you&rsquo;ve made. <code>git</code> saves your project as a
        sequence of edits to your code base rather than a set of
        file contents.</p>

      <div id="outline-container-org926c7db" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org926c7db">Motivation: Checkpoints</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org926c7db">
          <p>You have been writing code for hours. You&rsquo;ve got
          into a good flow. What started off as a few functions in
          a single file has expanded into dozens of functions and
          classes in half a dozen files each consisting of several
          hundred lines of code. At least. You save the latest line
          you wrote. After The Great Cherry Coke Debacle in
          freshman year where you lost two pages of your final
          paper hours before the deadline, you&rsquo;re very
          diligent about saving. But it has started to occur to you
          - not all saves are created equal. Saving code might have
          one of several purposes:</p>

          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li>To ensure that you don&rsquo;t lose what
            you&rsquo;ve done.</li>

            <li>To compile and run your code as a sanity
            check.</li>

            <li>To mark a checkpoint in your progress - a version
            of your code to backup and come back to if things
            break.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In a smaller, simpler project, you might have just
          copied the code into a different folder now and then. But
          what if you want to go back several checkpoints? or what
          if you forget? What if you want to copy something from
          the checkpoint you made three hours ago? What if you
          forgot to copy the checkpoint? Preparing for all of these
          eventualities leads to more and more complicated
          practices of saving and backing up your code. Eventually,
          you might find that you are annotating your checkpoints
          with little messages describing what exactly you&rsquo;ve
          done since the last one.</p>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org074587d">
        <p>While <code>git</code> is the underlying software that
        performs version control, <a href=
        "https:github.com">Github</a> is a website where users can
        host and collaborate on their repositories. Github provides
        many additional features such as <i>issues</i> for
        repositories where users can file bug reports or make
        feature requests, <i>code reviews</i> where users can
        provide feedback on each others code, and <i>project
        boards</i> which can help teams of developers to coordinate
        their work. Github also provides a framework to give
        developers easier access to various tools such as
        <i>continuous integration servers</i> and app hosting.</p>

      <h2 id="orgc7f5792">Anatomy of a git repo</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc7f5792">
        <p>A git repository, or repo for short, is just a normal
        folder with a subfolder named <code>.git/</code> containing
        metadata. The <code>.git</code> folder will contain
        information about previous commits, branches, and where the
        remote repos are located. Most repos will also contain one
        or more files called <code>.gitignore</code>. A
        <code>.gitignore</code> file tells git which files to skip
        adding to the repository. You might add things like
        <code>*.class</code> files in <i>Java</i> or
        <code>*.o</code> files for <i>C</i> projects to your
        <code>.gitignore</code> file. Repos hosted on Github might
        also have a <code>.github</code> folder to store
        configuration of Github specific features.</p>

        <p>If you open a repo folder in a file browser, you might
        not see some of these files or folders because the prefix
        <code>.</code> on a filename is an instruction to many
        operating systems to keep a file hidden. Many developer
        tools use <i>&ldquo;dotfiles&rdquo;</i> to store user
        settings invisibly. Most file explorers have options to
        make all files, including dotfiles, visible.</p>

        <p>Conceptually, there are three parts to the git repo. The
        <i>working directory</i> are the current state of the files
        in your repository. The <i>staging index</i> stores the the
        current <i>uncommitted</i> changes to the repo. Finally,
        the <i>commit history</i> stores all the incremental
        updates to the repository.</p>

        <p>The set of all the commits that have been added to the
        repository is called the <i>commit history</i>. When people
        <code>clone</code> the repository or <code>pull</code> to
        update their local copy with changes from the remote, they
        get a copy of the <i>commit history</i>. Each commit will
        have a unique reference which is shared across
        everyone&rsquo;s copy of the repository, allowing your
        teammates to all jump to a specific commit across different
        machines. Of course, you&rsquo;ll have to <code>add</code>,
        <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code> your changes to
        the remote before your teammates will be able see them!
        Below, we&rsquo;ll discuss how to do that.</p>

        <p class="verse">Commands in this primer are referenced by
        name. If you want to use these commands in the terminal,
        you will have to preface them with <code>git</code>. So
        <code>push</code> becomes <code>git push</code> in the
        terminal. If you are using a git client, like <a href=

          <i>clone</i> it to your local machine. The
          <code>clone</code> command takes the location of a repo
          and copies it to your local directory along with all the
          repo&rsquo;s history. The location provided to the

          repository or a file path, if you want to make a copy of
          a repository already on your computer. The cloned repo

          <p>To create a repo, you would perform a
          <code>init</code>. This creates a <code>.git</code>
          folder inside the current directory, making it the base
          directory of your new repo. At this stage, the repo
          considers itself to be empty. Even if there are files
          already in your directory, they won&rsquo;t be added to
          the repository until you explicitly start <i>tracking</i>
          them. In order to start <i>tracking</i> a file,
          you&rsquo;ll have to <code>add</code> and
          <code>commit</code> it to the repo. A repo created like

          a commit message describing its contents. It is important
          to leave descriptive commit messages so you and your
          collaborators can more easily go back and track what was
          changed, when, and by whom if something goes wrong. Since
          commits are a `unit&rsquo; in git repo, you may want to
          split a set of your latest code changes into multiple
          commits For example, grouping your commits by feature
          would allow you to better trace issues or remove features

          commit often<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href=

          <p class="verse">In general, synchronizing with the

      <h2 id="org8cf41d9">Branching and Merging</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8cf41d9">
        <p>A key features of git repos is the ability to create a
        branch of your code. Branches allow you switch between and
        develop multiple versions of your code simultaneously. If
        we decide that we want to combine two branches, we can
        perform a <code>merge</code>. Merging includes all the
        commits from one branch into another and then caps them off
        with a special merge commit to indicate that the two
        branches have been combined. This special merge commit can
        be used to resolve any conflicts that might have arisen. We
        will talk about merge conflicts a little later.</p>

        <p>The most common use for branches would be developing a
        new feature for a piece of software with an existing stable
        version. You don&rsquo;t want to add unstable code to the
        version that other people might be using, so you can make a
        branch to work on your feature until it is ready. As
        mentioned previously, a git repo stores the history as a
        sequence of <i>changes</i> to repo, not as files. That
        means in many cases changes made to code by different
        people can be automatically combined by git. This does
        <i>NOT</i> mean that the combined files will work! Make
        sure you test your code after every <code>merge</code> (and
        before every <code>push</code>).</p>

        <p class="verse">Your git repo has a <code>HEAD</code>
        pointer which refers to the revision/commit you&rsquo;re
        currently working on. When you switch to a branch, your
        <code>HEAD</code> pointer automatically gets moved to the
        latest commit on that branch.<br /></p>

      <div id="outline-container-org6d0f145" class="outline-3">
        <h3 id="org6d0f145">A sample branching paradigm</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d0f145">
          <p>Most repositories have a single branch to start with,
          called <code>main</code><sup><a id="fnr.4" class=
          "footref" href="#fn.4" name="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. This
          branch should contain the most recent `released&rsquo;
          version of your software. In early the early stages of
          development, of course, it might not be a finished
          product. Next, you might create a branch called
          <code>develop</code> to track less stable improvements to
          the software. Individual features will spawn their own
          branches off of <code>develop</code> and be merged back
          into <code>develop</code> as they are completed. When the
          team is sufficiently sure that the code on
          <code>develop</code> is ready for release, it can be
          pushed to <code>main</code>.</p>

          <p>In order to make the most of this paradigm for
          branching, it is a good idea to set <i>milestones</i>
          which lists a set of features and fixes that are required
          before the next release. Features that do not contribute
          to the next milestone are left un-merged</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>When you perform a <code>merge</code>, you are
            taking commits from another branch and adding them to
            the branch you are currently on. For example, if you
            want the branch <code>main</code> to include changes
            made in <code>my-cool-feature-branch</code>, you would
            have to first checkout <code>main</code> and then
            <i>merge</i> <code>my-cool-feature-branch</code> into
            <code>main</code>.</p>

          existing commit. Once you&rsquo;ve created the new
          branch, you will need to switch to the branch by
          performing a <code>checkout --branch</code> to switch
          your <code>HEAD</code> pointer to the tip of the branch
          and make sure any future commits get added there.</p>

        <h3 id="orgbada2e4">Conflicts!</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbada2e4">
          <p>When pulling or merging changes from other branches,
          from time to time you will come across conflicts. These
          occur when two commits change the same line in a file.
          Merge conflicts are one of the most panic-inducing events
          associated with git. It is important to remember that all
          your work is safe as long as you&rsquo;ve been committing
          regularly.</p>

          <p>In the event that a segment of code has a conflict
          during a merge, that segment will be replaced with both
          versions of the code with in-text annotations to indicate
          the conflict. Below is an example of a conflict when
          merging <code>other-branch</code> into <code>main</code>.
          Note the line of <code>=</code>&rsquo;s separating the
          two alternatives.</p>
          <pre class="example">
This line does not have a conflict.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; main
this line has a conflict.
=======
This line is a conflict.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other-branch;
</pre>

          <p>If we were to look at the state of <code>main</code>
          before the merge began, we would see this:</p>
          <pre class="example">
This line does not have a conflict.
this line has a conflict.
</pre>

          <p>Similarly, if we were to look at the state of
          <code>other-branch</code> before the merge began, we
          would see this:</p>
          <pre class="example">
This line does not have a conflict.
This line is a conflict.
</pre>

          <p>In order to resolve the conflict, you need to edit
          each file with a conflict in it and remove the conflict
          markers. Each conflict in delimited by three lines:</p>

          <ol class="org-ol">
            <li><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; main</code></li>

            <li><code>=======</code></li>

            <li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            other-branch</code></li>
          </ol>

          <p>The text between lines <code>a</code> and
          <code>b</code> are the contents of the <code>main</code>
          branch and the text between <code>b</code> and
          <code>c</code> are the contents
          <code>other-branch</code>. Most times, you&rsquo;ll just
          choose either the text in <code>main</code> or the text
          that was in <code>other-branch</code>. Occasionally, you
          might have to choose lines from both or even add
          additional lines. In some cases you might want to keep
          some or all of both alternatives.</p>

          <p>Once you&rsquo;re done with the edits, make sure to
          test your code, commit the changes, and you&rsquo;re all
          done! Remember, there might be more than one conflict in
          a merge.</p>

          <p class="verse">You can usually find all the conflicts
          by searching for <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> in

          introducing errors to those branches can be disastrous to
          the whole team. In such situations, a pull-request might
          require the approval of multiple team members or of
          product managers. A pull request allows the team to
          discuss commits that are requested to be merged into a

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb5fc2b8">
        <p>Occassionally, you&rsquo;ll discover that a commit
        introduces errors or the approach you&rsquo;ve been taking
        to solving a problem is far more trouble than it is worth.
        In situations like this, you might want to undo or discard
        some changes you&rsquo;ve made.</p>

        <h3 id="org9a76f55">Temporary - <code>stash</code></h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9a76f55">
          <p><code>stash</code> is a very useful command which
          takes any <i>uncommitted</i> changes you&rsquo;ve made to
          the working directory and stores them safely. You can
          later <code>stash pop</code> to return the changes
          themselves to the working directory. Note that if you
          move some changes to your <code>stash</code> and then
          make conflicting changes, then you will have to resolve
          the conflicts. After you&rsquo;ve performed a
          <code>stash</code> to store some changes, you can
          <code>pull</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>,
          and <code>merge</code> as necessary before using
          <code>stash pop</code> to return your changes to the
          working directory.</p>

          <p class="verse"><code>stash</code> is a versatile
          command that allows you to save multiple uncommitted
          chunks as <code>WIP</code> or <i>work-in-progress</i>.
          You can navigate the list of stashed modifications using
          <code>stash list</code> and select a specific one to
          restore using <code>stash apply</code>. You can even give
          you stashed modifications descriptive commit
          messages.<br /></p>

        <h3 id="orgcfef600">UNDO! UNDO!! - <code>revert</code></h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcfef600">
          <p>Since each commit in git is a &rsquo;change&rsquo;,
          the natural way to undo things is to make the opposite
          change. <code>revert</code> will construct the inverse of
          a specific revision and commit it. This is great for two
          reasons. First, you haven&rsquo;t altered the <i>commit
          history</i> - just added to it. Second, you can target a
          specific commit from several days ago without undoing all
          the work you&rsquo;ve done since!</p>

            art. An ideal commit message has a short one line
            header and then a body that describes the the changes
            in more detail. Consider going over all the files
            you&rsquo;ve changed in the commit and leaving a short
            summary of what was changed and why.</p>

            <p>Merging your code with someone else&rsquo;s code is
            one of the more stressful processes when it comes to
            working in a team. While it is important to make sure
            your changes remain compatible with your
            teammates&rsquo; changes, you might want to avoid
            integrating partially completed features. By working on
            separate branches, you avoid issues surrounding merging
            code until actually necessary. Many teams will perform
            integration tests on a regular basis to ensure that
            teammates don&rsquo;t diverge too far. You will still
            have to perform the merges from time to time, but at
            least you can minimize the frequency and complexity of
            unexpected merge conflicts and bugs that manifest from
            combining different bodies of code.</p>

            <p>Having a number of commits between working versions
            of code is not usually a problem, however, it is a good
            idea to test your code thoroughly before pushing or
            merging on a shared branch.</p>

          <h4 id="org7a1f6af">Avoiding Conflicts</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7a1f6af">
            <p>The best way to deal with conflicts is to have as
            few of them as possible. Working on separate branches
            reduces the frequency with which you&rsquo;ll have to
            deal with conflicts, but that might open the door to
            much larger conflicts cropping up down the line.
            Conflicts will usually only occur when two people are
            editing the same segment of code. If this is happening,
            it probably means that two people are working on very
            closely related features! The best way to avoid
            conflicts in this case is to communicate with your team
            before hand and let everyone know what you&rsquo;re
            working on and collaborate proactively instead of
            reactively.</p>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga7e20aa">
          <p><code>git rm</code> will untrack a file that you have
          committed to the repository and delete the file from your
          disk. If you don&rsquo;t want to delete the file
          altogether, you can use the <code>git rm --cached</code>
          option. The file will be removed from the repo in your
          next commit but a copy will remain in your working
          directory. This option is great if you accidentally
          commit a file containing, say, private notes that
          don&rsquo;t belong in the team&rsquo;s repository.</p>
